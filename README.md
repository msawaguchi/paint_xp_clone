Aesthetic version of Windows XP Paint clone in pure VanillaJS!

So, last year I was very bored on a Sunday afternoon and then decided to replicate the Windows XP retro Paint with just VanillaJS.

Not all tools in the palette are working, some I forgot to do and others I just don't remember what they were for... 
So, yes! Unfortunately this project isn't finished ... :sob:

That's why I decided to change it to public, so anyone can help to complete this! :thumbsup:

Check out what's working:
